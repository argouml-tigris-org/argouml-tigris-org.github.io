<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><p class="line874">You can help, there are big tasks and small tasks waiting for you. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span><p class="line874">Here is a suggestion on how you could become part of the ArgoUML Project. This could be perceived as a ladder to climb but remember that if so it is firstly a ladder of levels of commitment and time spent by you. You get no prize for climbing higher, you just get more responsibility in the project. <span class="anchor" id="line-4"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span><ol type="1"><li>Use ArgoUML. <span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span></li><li class="gap"><p class="line862">Report bugs &amp; suggest enhancements. <span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span></li><li class="gap">There are bugs in ArgoUML. When you use ArgoUML you might encounter them where you least expect it. To help, make sure they are known about i.e. that there exists an issue in Issuezilla describing the problem. You need to be a registered user at Tigris to report bugs but notice that to add further comments to the issue you also need to have gotten a Role in the ArgoUML project. <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span>Like all good open-source projects, ArgoUML is evolving to meet the needs of its users. We can only do this if we know what users need, so please file enhancement requests. <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span>To help the developers prioritise work on bugs and enhancements, vote for the ones that you really care about. <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span>You need to be a registered user at Tigris to report bugs and enhancements (and to vote for them) but notice that to add further comments to the issue you also need to have gotten a Role in the ArgoUML project. <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span></li><li class="gap">Subscribe to some of the users' mailing lists. <span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span>Discuss how you use ArgoUML in your project and how you promote ArgoUML in your organization. You can also help other users with their ArgoUML-related problems. <span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><p class="line862">There is one users' mailing list for each language project (Spanish, Swedish, Chinese, ...) for the users that prefer to discuss ArgoUML using that language. These are not currently (May 2006) very active but the main list, the English-speaking list at <a class="mailto" href="mailto:users@argouml.tigris.org-list">users@argouml.tigris.org-list</a>, is. <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span>In some cases there are also users' mailing lists for the specific subproject, for discussing these specific features or uses of them (cpp, andromda, ...). Prefer those if your discussion is for that area. <span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span></li><li class="gap">Apply for an Observer role. <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span>This shows that you are committed to the project and also allows you to comment on issues. <span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span></li><li class="gap">Familiarize yourself with the project and how we work. <span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span>Suggestion on how to go about this: <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><ol type="a"><li>Read through most of the User manual and install and run the latest version of ArgoUML. <span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span></li><li class="gap">Subscribe to the issues list. <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span>You will get updates on all issues so you can monitor what we are doing in the project.

Choose the ones you are interested in. <span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span>From this point on you can comment on bugs yourself directly in Issuezilla. <span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span>You can also close or verify issues. <span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span>This will help you understand the terminology used in the project and also gives you an idea of the current quality of ArgoUML and what needs to be done in the future. <span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span>This is also a very low-commitment level task that could be completed in a couple of minutes (depending on your choice of issue). <span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span></li><li class="gap">Read the rest of the Developers Wiki (used to be Developers Cookbook). <span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-61"></span>There is a lot of stuff discussed in here that is interesting for your understanding of the project and the code. <span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span></li><li class="gap">Check out the source from subversion and build. <span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-65"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span></li></ol></li><li class="gap">Subscribe to some of the dev mailing lists. <span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span>There is one dev mailing list for each project with the purpose of discussing the specifics for that project.
