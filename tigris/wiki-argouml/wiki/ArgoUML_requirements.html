Good compilers are helpful in pinpointing where the problem is (what line and what token is in error). The text fields in ArgoUML are not developed in the same way as source code and we have no compiler step to verify it all. Instead this validation needs to be done while editing meaning that the user needs all the help he can get, as quickly as possible, to get the syntax right. <br />

If a mistyping generates such a problem the user might lose interest in ArgoUML as a tool because he percieves it as not working correctly. <span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span><p class="line867"><a href="./Stakeholder:_User_of_ArgoUML.html">Stakeholder: User of ArgoUML</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span><p class="line867">
