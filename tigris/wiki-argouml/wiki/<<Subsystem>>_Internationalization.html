<span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><p class="line874">This is the responsibility of the language team. <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><p class="line874">If you are a member of the language team, commit the new translation. <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><p class="line874">If you are not, send your corrections to the correct team by mail or enter an issue in issuezilla. Each language team might want to handle this differently. Whatever way, it should is stated on the web site for that team.

<span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><p class="line874">Contact the project leader of the ArgoUML project to discuss this.

<span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span><p class="line874">This is only applicable for members of the language team. <span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span><p class="line874">Make sure you are a Developer in the appropriate language project. <span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span><p class="line874">Look at the files in org/argouml/i18n, under argouml/src_new (in the argouml project). <span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span><p class="line874">Translate all the values in each of these files. <span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><p class="line874">This is a lot of extremely qualified work including searching well-known literature on UML and Software Engineering in order to get the correct terms for the domain.

<h4 id="head-4e35d85489a690fef928080659564a6d274c063c">...add or modify code with localized things?</h4>
<span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span><p class="line874">This is only applicable for developers working with the ArgoUML Java source or some argouml module. <span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span><p class="line874">Everywhere the user would see a string in the GUI you should localize a key. <span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span><p class="line874">This means that instead of writing a string you write a call to a localizer method with a "key" ("label" or "tag") as argument and the localizer method finds the resolution of the "key" is in one of the property files. You select one of the files for you key and name the key accordingly. <span class="anchor" id="line-72"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-73"></span><p class="line874">The key is a String. The key has a special syntax like this: <span class="anchor" id="line-74"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-75"></span><pre>    word1.word2.word3
<span class="anchor" id="line-76"></span></pre><span class="anchor" id="line-77"></span><p class="line862">where <tt>word1</tt> is the same as the first part of the filename that the key resides in. Example: The key "action.about-argouml" resides in the file <strong>action.properties</strong> and <strong>action_<em>language code</em>.properties</strong>. <span class="anchor" id="line-78"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-79"></span><p class="line874">You will have to call the class org.argouml.i18n.Translator to convert them to wherever they are used. <span class="anchor" id="line-80"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-81"></span><p class="line874">This is how a real example would look: <span class="anchor" id="line-82"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-83"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-84"></span><pre>import org.argouml.i18n.Translator;
<span class="anchor" id="line-85"></span>...
<span class="anchor" id="line-86"></span>    String localized = Translator.localize(key);
<span class="anchor" id="line-87"></span></pre><span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span><p class="line874">Add your "key" and resolution in English (U.S.) in the non-localized properties file in argouml/src_new/org/argouml/i18n and test that the GUI looks good for the default language. <span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-91"></span><p class="line874">Which property file ArgoUML will eventually use depends on the localization settings of the running ArgoUML instance. While developing you should use en_US or some language that does not have a translation so that you can work with the default language. <span class="anchor" id="line-92"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-93"></span><p class="line867">
<h4 id="head-7e75ac75945802f1c99da4c33d7fe5efc0038b50">Contact all language-teams so that they can update their files?</h4>
<span class="anchor" id="line-94"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-95"></span><p class="line874">Currently (November 2003) there is great confusion as to where we stand on the different translations. For this reason we can't say if any language team is up to date with the changes and served by such a contact. <span class="anchor" id="line-96"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-97"></span><p class="line862">If you have strings that are sentences where you have dynamic values like a file name, a class name, or some property to enter at a certain place, remember that all languages would not write it exactly like that. Use <a class="nonexistent" href="http://argouml.tigris.org/wiki/MessageFormat">?</a>MessageFormat to build every such sentence! There is a convenience function for this in Translator called messageFormat. <span class="anchor" id="line-98"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-99"></span><p class="line874">Notice that if you somewhere change the meaning of a specific localized string it would be a good idea to use a new "key" for the new meaning. This will make it easier for the translation team to spot the modification. <span class="anchor" id="line-100"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-101"></span><p class="line874">There allegedly are tools in the java world to spot these kinds of changes. Until we have the tools and processes in place to handle them it is better to rely on this simpler mechanism to guarantee correctness. <span class="anchor" id="line-102"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-103"></span><p class="line874">Notice also that you shouldn't localize log entries, comments, exception names, names of environment variables, and tags and tokens used in save files. This is because the development project of ArgoUML is a one-language community (en_US) and the users of ArgoUML would want to be able to run an ArgoUML localized differently with otherwise the exact same settings, loading and saving the same files, ... Also a user, changing the language, should not have his files or configuration corrupted by this change. <span class="anchor" id="line-104"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-105"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-106"></span><p class="line867">
