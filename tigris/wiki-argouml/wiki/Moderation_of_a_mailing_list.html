<span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span>Hello!
<span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span>You have written a mail to an ArgoUML mailing list. Your 
<span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span>mail was not automatically approved by the mailing list 
<span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span>mechanism but instead sent to me, the moderator, for 
<span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span>approval. Most likely, this is because you are not 
<span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span>subscribed to the list or the from field of the sent 
<span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span>mail was different from the mail address that is 
<span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span>subscribed to the list so the list mechanism don't 
<span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span>consider you as subscribed.
<span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span>As a moderator, I assume that this was a misstake. 
<span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span>Either a misstake to send the mail to the list in the 
<span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span>first place since the list don't accept mails from 
<span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span>non-subscribers, or a misstake in using the incorrect 
<span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span>from address. For this reason I have not approved you 
<span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span>mail for the mailing list. If the misstake was that you 
<span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span>had forgot to subscribe, please subscribe and resend the 
<span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span>mail. If the misstake was that you used the incorrect 
<span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span>from address, please resend the mail using the correct 
<span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span>from address.
<span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span>If this is not a misstake, I assume that this is because 
<span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span>you are subscribed to the mailing list with one mail 
<span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span>address and wants to (or has to) send mails using another. 
<span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span>This is possible, however some special allowing is 
<span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span>possible. If this is the case, please send me a mail at 
<span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span>linus@tigris.org explaining this and including your two 
<span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span>mail addresses, and then send the mail immediately again. 
<span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span>Then I will approve the mail and allow your mail address 
<span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span>so that future postings will go through immediately.
<span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span>There are two reasons for not allowing posts to the list 
<span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span>without being a member. The first one is from a spam 
<span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span>fighting perspecting. The ArgoUML mailing lists attract 
<span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span>a fair amount of commercial messages and scams that we 
<span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span>don't want to resend to all list members. The second one 
<span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span>is that answers to your postings on the list are always 
<span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span>sent back to the list. Unless you are a member you will 
<span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span>miss it. For this reason, if you become a member on the 
<span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span>list just to send a single mail, please linger on the 
<span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span>list for a couple of weeks to receive any answers or 
<span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span>follow-ups to your mail.
<span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span>I hope that you accept the policy and the measure taken 
<span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span>by me, the moderator and wish you welcome to the ArgoUML 
<span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span>project and the mailing list.
