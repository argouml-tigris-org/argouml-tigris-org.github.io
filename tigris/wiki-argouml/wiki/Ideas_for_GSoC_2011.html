<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><p class="line862">In the ArgoUML project we were hoping that we will be able to take part in Google Summer of Code 2011. The ArgoUML project has taken part before with great success. ArgoEclipse and the Profile handling are essentially student projects. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span><p class="line874">Unfortunately, ArgoUML was not a chosen organization for 2011. <span class="anchor" id="line-4"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span><p class="line867">

<h3 id="head-1b2344609893888b1ddd2fc39ec00ea85a3ff2a0">Reading an UML 1 model into an UML 2 model</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><p class="line874">ArgoUML is still based on an UML 1.* model while some work has been done to support the euml backend for UML 2. Moving all the way to euml will make ArgoUML compatible with the whole range of euml-based tools i.e. all Eclipse-based UML tools as well as new Diagram types. <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span><p class="line874">Currently this is implemented using two separate backends for ArgoUML. <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><p class="line874">To allow the ArgoUML Users to move their old models from UML 1 to UML 2 we need a way to read the old UML 1 models from within the UML 2 model backend preserving all the information (element types are changed, texts, relations, Uids, profile connections are preserved...). There is also a need to dig into the differences between UML 1 and UML 2 and decide how incompatible constructs are to be handled. <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><p class="line874">The diagram shows a possibility for placing the model conversion function and several options for reading the UML 1 model. <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><p class="line867"><img class="attachment" src="ArgoUML_Model_Conversion.png"  /> <span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><p class="line867">
<h3 id="head-03ec8893a329395bcb4b3d30b40abad112c48808">UML 2 Graphics</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><p class="line862">For the drawing of elements in the model, ArgoUML uses GEF (not the one that was a part of Eclipse but the tigris one (<a class="http" href="http://gef.tigris.org">http://gef.tigris.org</a>). GEF and ArgoUML stores the graphics in a non-standard way while UML 2 has a standardized ways of storing the graphics. <span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><p class="line874">This project is to explore what it would take to make ArgoUML and GEF to store and read graphics using the standardized format. <span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><p class="line862">Suggested by: <a href="linus.html">Linus Tolke</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><p class="line874">We are looking for enthusiastic students with a solid knowledge of Java, who are interested in software development tools and modeling, particularly the UML modeling language. A knowledge of UML is not a requirement but a interest and eagerness to learn is. <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><p class="line874">This wiki contains a lot of information on the design of ArgoUML and how we work in the project. <span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><p class="line862">All discussions about the ArgoUML project, the ideas above, and other ideas, are kept at the developers' mailing list <a class="mailto" href="mailto:dev@argouml.tigris.org">dev@argouml.tigris.org</a> that also is available as a discussion forum on this site (at <a class="http" href="http://argouml.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=450">http://argouml.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=450</a>).
