<span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span><p class="line862">There is little documented about how changes to the UML model are reflected on the diagram in a consistent way. Diagrams and diagram elements (<tt>Fig</tt>s) have been designed by various developers without a common standard. Over time implementation of notations and change of UML model repository have introduced changes which have unexpected side effects and for which there are short term work around. <span class="anchor" id="line-4"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span><p class="line874">This page is an attempt to formalize a common way of working for all diagram elements. It is to clearly separate GUI from notation and UML model and prevent excessive reconstruction of the GUI composite parts and excessive adding and removal of listeners from the GUI to notation and UML model. <span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><p class="line874">The existing diagrams do not fit what is described here. This description is documenting the approach taken in development of the Activity diagram for UML2. Once development of that diagram is stable the lessons learned here will be used in other diagram types as they split out into their own modules. <span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><p class="line867">
