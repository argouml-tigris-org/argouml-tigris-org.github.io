<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><p class="line874">The purpose of this description is to simplify the procedure for the person actually doing the release work, and to make sure that everything is done in the exact same way every time without anything being forgotten. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span><p class="line874">The scripts involved have been developed and are mostly run on a Cygwin system. They will hopefully work on any UNIX system but most likely they will need some adjustments. <span class="anchor" id="line-4"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span><p class="line874">The scripts and tools used specifically for the build are maintained in the argoumlinstaller project. From the argouml project the files argouml/build.xml and other build.xml files are reused. <span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><p class="line874">Prerequisites (what you need to be able to do this): <span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">Subversion write access to the argouml projects (to create the releases branch/tag). The projects involved are specified in the file <strong>argoumlinstaller/build-release.sh</strong>. <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span></li><li>Subversion write access to the argouml-downloads project (to upload the result). <span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span></li><li>A machine with 10GB of disk to use for this purpose (October 2009. In September 2006 it was 3GB). <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">This is probably the machine you use for your development if you are an argouml developer. <span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">The machine needs Internet access (it is not a small download and upload so at least 128KB Internet connection to keep the time reasonable &lt; 2 hours), the correct version of Java installed (should be a JDK for Java5), SVN installed, Unix or Cygwin to be able to run the scripts. <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span></li><li>The argoumlinstaller and argouml-downloads projects checked out alongside each other. <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">If this is not in place from a previous release this is done using the commands <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none"><span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><pre>cd wherever
<span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span>svn co http://argoumlinstaller.tigris.org/svn/argoumlinstaller/trunk argoumlinstaller

<span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span></pre><span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">Note that the <strong>argouml-downloads</strong> checkout is large (over 6 GB download) and will take a considerable time to check out so you'd better do this in advance. <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span></li><li><p class="line862">The <strong>JimiProClasses.zip</strong> downloaded and copied into <strong>argoumlinstaller/build</strong>. <span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span></li><li>You have generated a key to sign the jar files (for Java Web Start). <span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">Run the command <tt>keytool&nbsp;-list&nbsp;-v</tt> and give the keystore password <strong>secret</strong>. You should have a key named argouml that is valid several months in the future. <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">This is to make sure that you have a valid key for the purpose of signing the jar files. <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Since the ArgoUML project and the Tigris organization are loose organizations we cannot buy a "real" key. The keys we use are the unsigned keys that can be generated by anyone using the keytool provided with Java. <span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">A key is generated with the command <tt>keytool&nbsp;-genkey&nbsp;-alias&nbsp;argouml&nbsp;-storepass&nbsp;secret</tt>. <span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">By default these keys have a validity of just three (3) months but by giving the -validity days the validity can be extended. <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Don't forget to upload your new key to the Downloads area. This is for those who want to see the key on the site separately. <span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">Here are the steps to be done when one actually does a release: <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><ol type="1"><li>Check for new projects. <span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">If there are any new projects to be included in the release, add them to the list of projects in <strong>argoumlinstaller/build-release.sh</strong>. You also need to create the <strong>releases</strong>-directory at the top of the SVN repository. <span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span></li><li>Create the release branch/tag and checkout that copy. <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">This is done using the command <tt>./build-release.sh&nbsp;-tc</tt> in the argoumlinstaller project and giving the release name. <span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">You must have set JAVA_HOME for this to work. <span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">The script will check that the releases top directory is present in all the involved projects and that the given release name is not already present in any of the involved projects. <span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span></li><li>Set the version to not include the "PRE-" part and commit the files. <span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">This is done in the <strong>ArgoVersion.java</strong>-file in <strong>build/VERSION_<em>GIVEN_VERSION</em>/argouml/src/argouml-app/src/org/argouml/application</strong> and in the <strong>build.xml</strong>-file in <strong>build/VERSION_<em>GIVEN_VERSION</em>/argouml-documentation</strong>. <span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span></li><li>Build ArgoUML and the sub-projects, and sign the jar files. <span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">This is done using the command <tt>./build-release.sh&nbsp;-bs</tt> <span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span></li><li>Build the pdf version of the documentation. <span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">This is done using the command <tt>./build-release.sh&nbsp;-d</tt> <span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span></li><li>Go through Issuezilla and check things. <span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Things to check are: <span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span><ol type="a"><li>That there is a Version created in Issuezilla for the newly created release. <span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">The purpose of this is to make it possible for everyone to report bugs on the new release. <span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Make sure that the upcoming releases have target milestones created for them<sup><a href="Making_a_release.html#fndef-9fa2f5a873db13ec21be2afe9eacb8947a2e89f3-0" id="fnref-9fa2f5a873db13ec21be2afe9eacb8947a2e89f3-0">1</a></sup>.

Since 'current' will be reused for the next release, they need to be locked to the closest release to where they were found. <span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span></li><li>Reopen RESOLVED/REMIND <span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">This can also be a good time to change all RESOLVED/REMIND. Search for them and Reopen them. <span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span></li><li>Check RESOLVED/LATER <span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">It could also be good to check that all RESOLVED/LATER has a valid target milestone (must be an upcoming milestone). Search for them and Reopen the ones that haven't. Also, if the milestone denotes or is going to be resolved in the upcoming release, Reopen them with a comment that they are now active. <span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span></li><li>For stable releases, decide on when FIXED issues that are RESOLVED or VERIFIED will be closed. <span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Add a message to all VERIFIED issues and verify all RESOLVED issues stating when they will be closed.
