<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><dl><dt>Code Generation / Reverse Engineering </dt><dd>Code Generation and Reverse Engineering are the processes of converting between the ArgoUML UML model and program code in a certain programming language. ArgoUML supports different languages such as Java, C++ and PHP for Code Generation and Reverse Engineering, but both are not supported for all languages equally. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span></dd></dl><span class="anchor" id="bottom_Include_Terminology/Code_Generation_and_Reverse_Engineering"></span></div><div dir="ltr" id="Include_Terminology/Critic" lang="en"><span class="anchor" id="top_Include_Terminology/Critic"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><dl><dt>Critic </dt><dd>A critic is a part of ArgoUML that runs as a separate asynchronous process to check the quality of the model. Once a flaw has been found, it creates a so called critique. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span></dd></dl><span class="anchor" id="bottom_Include_Terminology/Critic"></span></div><div dir="ltr" id="Include_Terminology/Critique" lang="en"><span class="anchor" id="top_Include_Terminology/Critique"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><dl><dt>Critique </dt><dd>A todo item created by a critic. The critic creates a critique to communicate the details of the dicovered model flaw to the user, e.g. it explains the reason why this is a bad design. The critique also allows the user to start a wizard to automate fixing the problem. There are also todo items that are created by the user - these are not called critique. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span></dd></dl><span class="anchor" id="bottom_Include_Terminology/Critique"></span></div><div dir="ltr" id="Include_Terminology/Delete" lang="en"><span class="anchor" id="top_Include_Terminology/Delete"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><dl><dt>Delete </dt><dd>Usually used as "Delete from Model". The object will be destructed, and will not be present any more on any diagram, nor in the model. Additionally, all objects that can not exist without the deleted object are deleted from the model, too. E.g. deleting a class also deletes all its associations. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span></dd></dl><span class="anchor" id="bottom_Include_Terminology/Delete"></span></div><div dir="ltr" id="Include_Terminology/Dependency" lang="en"><span class="anchor" id="top_Include_Terminology/Dependency"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><dl><dt>Dependency </dt><dd>A piece of software that is developed by someone outside of the ArgoUML project and that the ArgoUML project is not responsible for. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span><ul><li style="list-style-type:none">The ArgoUML product, like almost any other software project, use dependencies so that we don't have to do everything ourselves.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><dl><dt>Import </dt><dd>Import some other format into an existing structure. This implies that there is some kind of conversion involved and that the already existing things are not removed. They are either changed or left unchanged by the import. An Export, New, Import cycle can lead to information loss because of the two conversions involved. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span></dd></dl><span class="anchor" id="bottom_Include_Terminology/Import"></span></div><div dir="ltr" id="Include_Terminology/Library" lang="en"><span class="anchor" id="top_Include_Terminology/Library"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><dl><dt>Library </dt><dd>A part of a dependency that is installed and handled as a unit in the ArgoUML building and installation set-up. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span></dd></dl><span class="anchor" id="bottom_Include_Terminology/Library"></span></div><div dir="ltr" id="Include_Terminology/Module" lang="en"><span class="anchor" id="top_Include_Terminology/Module"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><dl><dt>Module </dt><dd>A piece of software that is to be loaded into ArgoUML by the Module Loader. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span><ul><li style="list-style-type:none">Modules traditionally use the Plug-in interfaces and are for that reason also known as Plug-ins. <span class="anchor" id="line-4"></span></li></ul></dl><span class="anchor" id="bottom_Include_Terminology/Module"></span></div><div dir="ltr" id="Include_Terminology/New" lang="en"><span class="anchor" id="top_Include_Terminology/New"></span>

<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><dl><dt>Notation </dt><dd>Notation is the textual representation of model fragments on a diagram. ArgoUML supports Notation in different languages such as UML and Java. Notation may be not only pure text: e.g. UML attributes/operations have graphical text properties (underlining, italics) with a semantic relevance. To be shown on a diagram, the text has to be created by a generator, and when the user edits the text on the diagram, a parser processes the text, and adapts the model accordingly. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span></dd></dl><span class="anchor" id="bottom_Include_Terminology/Notation"></span></div><div dir="ltr" id="Include_Terminology/Open" lang="en"><span class="anchor" id="top_Include_Terminology/Open"></span>

<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><dl><dt>Remove </dt><dd>Usually used as "Remove from Diagram". The object that will be removed is not deleted from the model, i.e. it still exists, but is simply not present any more on the current diagram. It might still be present on other diagrams, or not, but it is surely present in the explorer. Additionally, all objects that cannot be drawn without the removed object, are removed from the diagram, too. E.g. removing a class also removes all its associations. Once removed, an object can be "added" to a diagram (again). <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span></dd></dl><span class="anchor" id="bottom_Include_Terminology/Remove"></span></div><div dir="ltr" id="Include_Terminology/Save" lang="en"><span class="anchor" id="top_Include_Terminology/Save"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><dl><dt>Save </dt><dd>Save the existing project to a file. The Save operation saves everything (it is a no-loss operation). A Save, Open cycle does not loose any information. (Don't use Export, or Write for this). <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span></dd></dl><span class="anchor" id="bottom_Include_Terminology/Save"></span></div><div dir="ltr" id="Include_Terminology/Todo_item" lang="en"><span class="anchor" id="top_Include_Terminology/Todo_item"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><dl><dt>Todo item </dt><dd>A "to do" item presents feedback to the designer about activities to be performed on the model. This feedback can be automatically generated (by the critics), or by the designer himself. The use of a "to do" list fits in ArgoUML's use of cognitive features - see the Robbins Dissertation on ArgoUML for more details. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span></dd></dl><span class="anchor" id="bottom_Include_Terminology/Todo_item"></span></div> <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><a href="CategoryFromCookbook.html">CategoryFromCookbook</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div><p id="pageinfo" class="info" lang="en" dir="ltr">Terminology  (last edited 2009-01-06 01:46:29 -0700 by <span title="Linus Tolke @ localhost[127.0.0.1]"><a href="linus.html" title="Linus Tolke @ localhost[127.0.0.1]">linus</a></span>)</p>
