<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><p class="line874">This can be performed by any member of the project (any role). Persons without the Developer role need a person with the Developer role to actually commit the work if the resolution involves changing some artifact. There might be special skills involved but it differs widely depending on the nature of the Issue. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span><p class="line874">Do the following: <span class="anchor" id="line-4"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span><ol type="1"><li>Pick any Issue that is NEW or REOPENED that you from the description think that you are able to solve. Best results are often obtained if you find an Issue that you really feel needs to be solved. The list of all of them. <span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span></li><li>Look at your personal schedule and how much time you have during the next couple of weeks and compare that to the amount of time you think you will need to spend for solving the issue. Compare this to the release plan to see what release your contribution will fit in. <span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span></li><li>Accept the Issue and reserve it by assigning it to yourself. Set the Target Milestone to the release you have chosen. <span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span></li><li>Make sure you have a checked out copy of ArgoUML or else check out a new one. <span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">How this is done is described in <a href="Building_from_source.html">Building from source</a>. <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span></li><li>Mark the issue as Started (this could be done while assigning also). <span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span></li><li>Change the code to solve the problem. <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span></li><li>Compile and test your new code. <span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">This should include developing a JUnit test case to verify that the problem is solved. You could also develop the JUnit test case before actually solving the problem. <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">If your solution did not work as intended, continue changing it until it does. <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">If you feel that your estimation of the complexity of the problem and your own abilities and time available was incorrect, then change the Target Milestone of the Issue to another one that fits your new estimation. This is just a change of plan. <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">If you, at this point, feel that your personal plans have changed so that you won't have time to pursue the work, change the Issue back to "NEW" with your experiences so far stated in the comment. This means that you are giving up and giving the Issue back to anyone. You should also assign it back to issues@argouml or if you know someone else in the ArgoUML team that will continue the work, assign it to him. Remember not to commit your changes in the main branch but please commit your changes (if any) into a work branch and state the name of the branch in the issue. That will make it possible for someone to make use of your work so far. <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span></li><li>Commit your changes and the JUnit test cases stating the number of the Issue in the comment. <span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">If you don't have a developer role in the project, this involves sending your changes to someone who has and then convincing him to commit them for you. <span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span></li><li>"Resolve" the Issue with the resolution "FIXED". <span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Also set the target milestone of the upcoming release that will include the fix. <span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span></li><li>Sit back and feel the personal satisfaction of having completed something that will be part of the ArgoUML product. <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span></li><li>If you during this, have discovered other problems, create new Issues stating those new problems according to the rule for creating Issues. <span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span></li></ol><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><a href="CategoryFromCookbook.html">CategoryFromCookbook</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div><p id="pageinfo" class="info" lang="en" dir="ltr">How to resolve an Issue  (last edited 2009-01-24 17:19:57 -0700 by <span title="Linus Tolke @ localhost[127.0.0.1]"><a href="linus.html" title="Linus Tolke @ localhost[127.0.0.1]">linus</a></span>)</p>
