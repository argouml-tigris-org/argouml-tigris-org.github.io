ArgoUML is a big project with lots of legacy code that we do not know exactly how it works. Deprecation shows the intent between decision to remove a method and the point where it is actually removed and this without breaking anything of the old code. There are also modules or plug ins that we might know nothing about that could be loaded by some user to run within ArgoUML to add functionality. It is for the modules and plug ins that we always save deprecated methods to the next stable release. It makes it possible for the module developers to do work during the unstable releases and release at the same time as ArgoUML releases its stable release. Failing to maintain API stability will discourage developers from creating new modules for ArgoUML. <span class="anchor" id="line-148"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-149"></span></li><li class="gap">Don't use deprecated methods or classes. <span class="anchor" id="line-150"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-151"></span></li><li class="gap" style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line891"><em>Rationale</em>: Deprecation is an indication that a class is to be removed. We always want to build ArgoUML in a way that allows for future updates of everything. Using things that are on the way out already when doing the implementation is for this reason not allowed. <span class="anchor" id="line-152"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-153"></span></li><li class="gap" style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line891"><em>Rationale 2</em>: If you feel like you really want to use a method that is deprecated instead of the replacement you should first convince the person responsible for doing the deprecation that he has made a mistake and upgrade ArgoUML to a version of that library without that method or class deprecated. If it is within ArgoUML discuss it with the person who actually did the deprecation or in the development team. <span class="anchor" id="line-154"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-155"></span></li><li class="gap" style="list-style-type:none">Comment: There is an ongoing task (probably perpetually) to change the calls to deprecated methods and classes that have been deprecated after use in ArgoUML. This is a normal part of improving ArgoUML. If this work is too slow it makes it impossible to upgrade to new versions of different sub-tools. This problem is seen by "the person responsible for sourcing of the sub-tool" when actually trying to upgrade the sub-tool. (See Section 9.6, “How to relate issues to problems in dependencies”.) <span class="anchor" id="line-156"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-157"></span></li><li class="gap">Don't use very long package and class names. <span class="anchor" id="line-158"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-159"></span></li><li class="gap" style="list-style-type:none">To make the code readable, keep class names shorter than 25 chars, and have at most four levels of packages. <span class="anchor" id="line-160"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-161"></span></li><li class="gap" style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">Historically in the ArgoUML design, a deep package structure was used. There are several places in the code where the package structure is mimicking the UML hierarchy of objects resulting in impossibly long package names like <tt>org.argouml.model.uml.behavioralelements.collaborations.class&nbsp;name</tt>, and <tt>org.argouml.uml.ui.behavior.common_behavior.class&nbsp;name</tt>. <span class="anchor" id="line-162"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-163"></span></li><li class="gap" style="list-style-type:none">While establishing the subsystems we use a two-level approach much like the rest of the Java world. For the subsystem API we always use: org.argouml.subsystem package name i.e. the classes are in the subsystem's directory and all subsystems have package names that is a single level below org.argouml. If a subsystem is really complex or will be complex w.r.t. the amount of classes (meaning more than 50 files with classes), we create new packages with internal classes on a single level below the subsystem package. <span class="anchor" id="line-164"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-165"></span></li><li class="gap" style="list-style-type:none">This is the plan for the subsystems and new classes. Don't move old classes just yet! That would create more confusion that it would help. <span class="anchor" id="line-166"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-167"></span></li><li class="gap">For everything else follow Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language (called Sun Code Conventions)! <span class="anchor" id="line-168"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-169"></span></li></ul><p class="line862">Some of these rules are marked with a comment that they are checked by a Checkstyle. Checkstyle is a tool available with the ArgoUML development environment preconfigured for these rules. The current configuration can be found in <strong>argouml/tools/checkstyle/checkstyle5_argouml.xml</strong> (and <strong>argouml/tools/checkstyle/checkstyle_argouml.xml</strong> for previous versions of Checkstyle). <span class="anchor" id="line-170"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-171"></span><p class="line874">Look at the result of the Continuous Integration server to see the found checkstyle problems. <span class="anchor" id="line-172"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-173"></span><p class="line874">Checkstyle will also check some of the rules from the Sun Code Conventions that are not stated here. Furthermore Checkstyle enforces the order of modifiers to conform to the suggestions in the Java Language Specification, Section 8.1.1, 8.3.1, 8.4.3. <span class="anchor" id="line-174"></span><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-175"></span><a href="CategoryFromCookbook.html">CategoryFromCookbook</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-176"></span><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div><p id="pageinfo" class="info" lang="en" dir="ltr">When Writing Java Code  (last edited 2011-08-10 22:35:56 -0700 by <span title="Linus Tolke @ localhost[127.0.0.1]"><a href="linus.html" title="Linus Tolke @ localhost[127.0.0.1]">linus</a></span>)</p>
