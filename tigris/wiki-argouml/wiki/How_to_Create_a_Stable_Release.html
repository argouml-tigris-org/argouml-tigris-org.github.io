<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><p class="line874">We have two kinds of releases of ArgoUML: <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><ul><li>Development releases. <span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span></li><li>Stable releases. <span class="anchor" id="line-4"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">Stable releases are supposed to be better quality-wise and are always advertised to the users community on the main ArgoUML home page and as a news announcement. <span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><p class="line874">Development releases are not supposed to be used by users and are only advertised to users for the purpose of recruiting developers or soliciting help with implementation and test of new features. <span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><p class="line874">To increase the quality of a stable release, a stable release is preceded by a period during which there are a sequence of releases with increased quality standards. <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span><p class="line874">The whole release schedule leading up to a stable release and patched stable release looks like this: <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="head-cb379b1a1bdb7a33917cdc6262538df8495e7105">Development Period</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><p class="line874">A period of one to several months where no special restrictions apply. <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><p class="line874">During this period we attempt to make one development release per month. The releases are named x.y.z where y is an odd number and z is counting upwards from 1. <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><p class="line874">The releases are checkpoints where: <span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><ul><li>Everything compiles (including the sub-projects). <span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span></li><li>The release script works. <span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span></li><li>No JUnit tests are failing. <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span></li><li>There are no P1 defects. <span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">The releases are used: <span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><ul><li>As reference points when reporting bugs. <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span></li><li>As reference points and convenient downloads for persons working with modules. <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">
<h2 id="head-bec67f2aa5c7d18afbfbbb70b5c6a7cabc5438fb">First Alpha</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><p class="line874">This is the enhancement freeze point. All enhancements that are not completed and committed in the main trunk before this point will not be included in the stable release. <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><p class="line874">The First Alpha release is named x.y.alpha1 or x.y.ALPHA_1 depending on the context. It marks the end of the Development Period and the start of the Alpha Period. <span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><p class="line874">Otherwise it works just like a development release. <span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="head-494f69a46d14865d60dd82daf514c58e77b14781">Alpha Period</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><p class="line874">A period of a couple of weeks where special restrictions apply when committing into the main trunk: <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><ul><li>Only bug fixes are allowed in the code. <span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Put the number of the DEFECT you are addressing by the commit in the message. <span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Test case code can be added. Documentation, web site and other things can be added. <span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Exceptions to this are requested to and approved by the Release Responsible before commit. <span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">During this period we attempt to make at least one Alpha Release each week. The releases are named x.y.alphaz where y is an even number and z is counting upwards from 1 that is the first alpha. <span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">The purpose of the releases and their use are the same as during the development period. <span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">
<h2 id="head-62cfb53c84a657229f2563e35503e69ec04bab7a">First Beta</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span><p class="line874">This is the bug fixes freeze point. All enhancements and bug fixes that are not completed and committed in the main trunk before this point will not be included in the stable release. A known problems list could be compiled at this point. <span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span><p class="line874">The first beta release is named x.y.beta1 or x.y.BETA_1 depending on the context. It marks the end of the Alpha Period and the start of the Beta Period. <span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span><p class="line874">It is the first release candidate for the stable release. Because of this it is required that: <span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span><ul><li>Everything compiles (including the sub-projects). <span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span></li><li>The release script works. <span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span></li><li>No JUnit tests are failing. <span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span></li><li>There are no P1 or P2 defects. <span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">Otherwise it works just like a development release. <span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="head-1087006ebb303293ba35b61483937b36f5899adc">Beta Period</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span><p class="line874">A period of a couple of weeks where the focus is quality assurance. Every developer should strive to: <span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span><ul><li>Test ArgoUML as thoroughly as possible. Especially the areas that are new or changed since the last release. <span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span></li><li>Test and close issues that are resolved to make sure the problem is gone. <span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span></li><li>Scrutinize the commits in the main trunk to see that no new bugs are introduced. <span class="anchor" id="line-61"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">Extreme caution applies when committing into the main trunk. Only under the following conditions are commits allowed: <span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span><ul><li>It is a fix to some DEFECT that was previously fixed but it was found during the verification that the solution was not correct or complete. <span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Reopen the DEFECT when the problem is found with a statement of what is still the problem. Put the number of the DEFECT you are addressing by the commit in the message together with the statement of the part of the problem. Resolve the DEFECT as FIXED and update the target milestone with the release name of the next beta. <span class="anchor" id="line-65"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Test case code can still be added. Final documentation and web site updates for the release are done. <span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span></li><li class="gap">All JUnit test cases are run from a cleaned checked out copy at the commit and no problems are found. <span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Exceptions to this are requested and approved by the Release Responsible before commit. <span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">If a new problem is found the following needs to be done before committing the solution: <span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span><ul><li>The problem is registered as a DEFECT. <span class="anchor" id="line-72"></span></li><li>The solution is implemented. <span class="anchor" id="line-73"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Here the requirement is a high on the quality and low impact of the solution. <span class="anchor" id="line-74"></span></li><li>A request is made to the Release Responsible to allow this change. <span class="anchor" id="line-75"></span></li><li>This is granted by the Release Responsible. <span class="anchor" id="line-76"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-77"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">During the period we attempt to release at least one beta release each week.

When we are confident that there are no more problems in this release we make the stable release without code changes compared to the last beta. <span class="anchor" id="line-80"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-81"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="head-364e849f27db5d58d78587e23060fec11969796b">Stable Release</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-82"></span><p class="line874">This marks the end of the Alpha and Beta Period and the start of the next Development Period. <span class="anchor" id="line-83"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-84"></span><p class="line874">The release is named x.y where y is an even number. <span class="anchor" id="line-85"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-86"></span><p class="line874">The release is used: <span class="anchor" id="line-87"></span><ul><li>By all users. <span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">It can also be used as a development release. <span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-91"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="head-2bde34a128fdeeaa6a00393b45de6a15047bc55d">A Stable Patch Release</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-92"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-93"></span><p class="line874">If we find a serious problem in the stable release we can decide to make a Stable Patch Release. <span class="anchor" id="line-94"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-95"></span><p class="line874">The following needs to be done before committing the solution: <span class="anchor" id="line-96"></span><ul><li>The problem is registered as a DEFECT stating that it is a problem in the Stable Release or a previous Stable Patch Release. <span class="anchor" id="line-97"></span></li><li>A working branch is created against the release tag of the Stable Release or Stable Patch Release and the solution is implemented in that branch. <span class="anchor" id="line-98"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Here the requirement is a high on the quality and low impact of the solution. <span class="anchor" id="line-99"></span></li><li>We decide that it is a serious problem and that we are going to do a Stable Patch Release. <span class="anchor" id="line-100"></span></li><li>Several developers scrutinize the solution, testing and verifying in the branch of the issue. <span class="anchor" id="line-101"></span></li><li>The Release Responsible creates a branch.
