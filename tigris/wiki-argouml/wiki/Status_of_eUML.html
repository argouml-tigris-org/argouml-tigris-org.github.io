There are both an Eclipse run configuration and an Ant target that can be used to start ArgoUML with the eUML subsystem instead of the MDR subsystem. To take it for a test drive, just select Run-&gt;"ArgoUML UML2-EUML debug" in Eclipse. <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><p class="line874">Bogdan did a bunch of work over the summer, but there's still lots and LOTS left to do to get ArgoUML to a complete UML 2.x implementation. You can get an idea of the state of completion of the eUML model subsystem itself by counting the number of occurrences of "TODO Auto-generated method stub" and comparing it to the total number of methods. <span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><p class="line874">The model subsystem itself is just one part of the story though. One of the reasons OMG was so late with UML 2 (and took until UML 2.1.1 to actually get a usable implementation) is because they changed SO MUCH. About the only thing that looks anything like it used to is Use Cases (which were pretty simple to start with). Now, a lot of the changes are good, but the volume of them will make for a huge amount of work in adapting ArgoUML. All of these changes bubble up through the software layers from the Model API (which is loosely based on UML 1.4) to the application logic to the user interface (where we tend to use UML terminology to make it easy for the user to map things back to the UML spec). Supporting both UML 1.4 and UML 2.1.1, whether for a transition period or for the longer term, will introduce an extra level of complexity. <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span><p class="line874">Upgrading UML 1.4 models from earlier versions of ArgoUML to UML 2.1.1 models is another facility which will be needed. Nothing has been done on that yet. <span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><p class="line874">The UML 1.3 to UML 1.4 transition was a huge chunk of work and we STILL don't have some of the "new" UML 1.4 features fully implemented (e.g. Tagged Value types other than String), but that transition will look absolutely trivial next to what needs to be done to implement the changes for UML 2.x. The good news is that because the last transition was done relatively recently, the organizational knowledge about how to go about this is still fresh in people's minds. <span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><p class="line874">In addition to determining the relative importance (and timing) of the UML 2.x migration, we also need to decide whether this is a one-way migration or whether there's a long term need for UML 1.4 support. <span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><p class="line862">By the way, you mention "EMF &amp; UML2" a couple of times, so just to head off any potential misconceptions, the implementation target is OMG's UML 2.1.1, not Eclipse's EMF or Eclipse's UML2 plugin. Those are just implementation details to get us where we need to go and won't be exposed to the end user. <span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span>(<a class="http" href="http://markmail.org/message/lfvuvwecx6a4jcx6">MarkMail link</a>) <span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span>Bogdan Pistol March 2008 - "Instead of estimating how much of the org.argouml.model interfaces are implemented by eUML, a better estimation is the current functionality of eUML in ArgoUML: what one can currently do with eUML in ArgoUML. <span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span><p class="line862">I suggest you to take a look at the source code (if you haven't done already) and run ArgoUML with the eUML implementation. Details about ArgoUML infrastructure and general architecture are in the cookbook (Moved to the wiki. See <a href="ArgoUML_Design,_The_Big_Picture.html">ArgoUML Design, The Big Picture</a>). You should read the it (or the relevant parts of it).

Every model subsystem should define it's own modelling constructs. MDR defines its owns and eUML likewise. For example in org.argouml.model.CoreFactory interface there is a createClass( ) method that should create the Class modelling construct. The MDR model subsystem implements the createClass( ) method and the implementation creates a org.omg.uml.foundation.core.UmlClass that is used as a UML Class modelling construct for the MDR implementation while the eUML model subsystem creates a org.eclipse.uml2.uml.Class (implementing the same createClass( ) method) that is used as a UML Class modelling construct for the eUML implementation. <span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-65"></span><p class="line874">As you can see, the eUML subsystem uses under the hood the Eclipse UML2 project to create modelling constructs. <span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span><p class="line862">Look at the <a class="http" href="http://argouml-stats.tigris.org/nonav/reports-java5/javadocs-api/index.html?org/argouml/model/package-summary.html">Factory interface</a> and you can observe all its subinterfaces that are responsible for creating UML modelling constructs. It's the job of the model subsystem to implement these interfaces and actually create some modelling constructs to be used further in the same model subsystem. <span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span><p class="line862">-&gt; is it like upgrading from UML 1.4 -&gt; UML 2.x ??? <span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span><p class="line874">Yep, because eUML uses Eclipse UML2 that makes it UML2.x compatible. The current usable model subsystem (that implements the org.argouml.model interface most completely) is the MDR model subsystem that is UML 1.4 compatible. So completing the eUML implementation would upgrade ArgoUML from UML 1.4 to UML 2.x <span class="anchor" id="line-72"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-73"></span><p class="line862">-&gt; What main role a student has to play in this project ? ie. implement Model Subsystem as much as its possible or what ? <span class="anchor" id="line-74"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-75"></span><p class="line874">The student should implement the model subsystem's interfaces, but this should be done incrementally. Incrementally means that you will implement what is needed in the model subsystem for a specific functionality (eg. You want to extend eUML so that in the use case diagram should be possible to create a "use case" and an "actor" and an "association" between them, this requires that the eUML model subsystem should be able to create use cases, actors and associations and glue them together) <span class="anchor" id="line-76"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-77"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-78"></span><p class="line874">In conclusion eUML will use standard mementos, and all other functionality should be added in ArgoUML. <span class="anchor" id="line-79"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-80"></span><p class="line867">

So, if a UML element is created it will not be listened, but when it will be atached to the model element the ContentAdapter will adapt itself to listen the newly added UML element. <span class="anchor" id="line-195"></span></li><li><p class="line862">I implemented the ModelEventPump to use this ContentAdapter (named RootContainerAdapter in eUML) and committed this final implementation. <span class="anchor" id="line-196"></span></li><li><p class="line862">I tweaked the ModelEventPump to listen efficiently a class of types and subtypes of model elements.

<span class="anchor" id="line-239"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-240"></span><p class="line874">From:   Bogdan Ciprian Pistol; <span class="anchor" id="line-241"></span>Date:   Jul 3, 2007 10:53:29 pm <span class="anchor" id="line-242"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-243"></span><p class="line874">Sorry for the late reports. In week 5 didn't worked much because I left Iasi (university town) to go in Mangalia (my home town) where i'll stay for the summer. <span class="anchor" id="line-244"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-245"></span><p class="line874">Achieved <span class="anchor" id="line-246"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">I spent quite a lot of time figuring out the way in which the model subsystem implementation should use an EditingDomain (which tracks changes to the model, and so it can support undo and redo). <span class="anchor" id="line-247"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-248"></span></li></ul><p class="line862">I presumed the UML model subsystem could have multiple instances (one for each editor - in the future would be desirable to have multiple editors in the same application). So it will be a 1-1 relationship between an eUML instance and an editing domain. Multiple instances of eUML will have their own EditingDomain, so every eUML could have an independent undo/redo stack. <span class="anchor" id="line-249"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-250"></span><p class="line862">There is a problem with the current Model.initialise(String) initialization and Model.setImplementation(ModelImplementation). In the current form it only allows one implementation of Model to be used as the Model. IMHO one should have the possibility to create multiple instances (how many it needs) of the implementation of the Model (maybe to support multiple editors in the same application). <span class="anchor" id="line-251"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-252"></span><ul><li>I debugged the ArgoUML application to see how a model element is created and used. I saw that when the user clicks, on mouse press event the element is created (without an owner), and then on mouse released event the owner is set. Why isn't the owner set also when the element is created? <span class="anchor" id="line-253"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-254"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">The eUML should be able to find out if it's inside an Eclipse plugin or in a stand alone application. In the case of a standalone application eUML should somehow know the location in the filesystem of the "org.eclipse.uml2.uml.resource" jar plugin. So I thought that a system property (System.getProperty(String key)) would be appropriate to define the path of the jar. So if this property is defined then it's the case of a standalone application, else it's an Eclipse plugin. <span class="anchor" id="line-255"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-256"></span><p class="line874">To do next <span class="anchor" id="line-257"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">continue the current implementation of the EditingDomain and submit the code ASAP <span class="anchor" id="line-258"></span></li><li>figure out the singleton pieces of the eUML implementation in the case of multiple eUML instances <span class="anchor" id="line-259"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-260"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">Problems <span class="anchor" id="line-261"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">I had some trouble understanding the relations between some classes in org.eclipse.uml2.common.edit.command and EMF commands and how actually they are used in conjunction with a model through implementation of EditingDomain (AdapterFactoryEditingDomain), and some other few classes. All the trouble had the cause that the classes have no javadoc. <span class="anchor" id="line-262"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-263"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-264"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">
