<span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span><p class="line874">The argouml source code and associated files are split across a number of sub-projects.  This page describes each of the directories within argouml and its associated sub-projects.  Each project follows the same approximate directory structure, but does not necessarily contain all of the files and directories listed below. <span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span><p class="line874">There are two types of places where you will find this directory structure: <span class="anchor" id="line-4"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">Sub-directories (modules) within the main argouml project, i.e. <tt class="backtick">http://argouml.tigris.org/svn/argouml/trunk/src/xxxx/</tt> <span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Sub-projects separate to the main argouml project, i.e. <tt class="backtick">http://argouml-yyyy.tigris.org/svn/argouml-yyyy/trunk/</tt> <span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">The listing below describes the files that you will find directly below the paths above. <span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><dl><dt>build.xml</dt><dd>The file controlling the build of that subsystem. <span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span></dd><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">When built, the results end up in a newly created build directory.

For clarity the README files and licenses and other distribution details of each used jar will also be stored in this directory. (Quick summary: BSD License, Apache License, LGPL are OK, GPL is not.) Don't forget to arrange for the modules version and license information to appear when starting ArgoUML and in the About box. <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Take care also to make the versions of these libraries explicit, so as to allow people building from sources to figure out exact dependencies. Easiest way is to rename the files to include version information, the same way as shared libraries in Unix world: foo-x.y.z.jar, bar-x.y.z.jar, etc... <span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span></li><dt>src</dt><dd>Source code. <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span></dd><li style="list-style-type:none">This directory contains exactly one java class tree that is built into exactly one jar file. <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span></li><dt>tests</dt><dd><p class="line862">Source code for JUnit tests of everything that is in the src directory.

However the requirement on the license is different. The tools are never distributed with ArgoUML but merely used in the development of ArgoUML so it is enough to have a license that does not allow distribution. (Quick summary: BSD License, Apache license, LGPL, GPL, Freeware are OK.) <span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span></li><li style="list-style-type:none">Configuration for a tool includes Eclipse configurations and checklipse settings. <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span></li><dt>META-INF</dt><dd>Specification of properties for Eclipse RCP plugins <span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span></dd><li style="list-style-type:none">These files are modified by Eclipse to keep track of the relationship between the Eclipse projects or built jar files. <span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span></li><dt>www</dt><dd><p class="line862">The project web site; only seen at this level in separate argouml sub-projects.
