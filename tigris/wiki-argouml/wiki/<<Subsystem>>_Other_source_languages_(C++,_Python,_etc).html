They are each different in level of support and implementation language. All languages except for Java are in their own dedicated Tigris project with separate web site, mailing lists, source repository, etc. For example, the C++ plugin is located here. <span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span><p class="line874">Currently C++ has a proof of concept reverse engineering module and a more mature code generation module, although still very simple. The Java classfile module has only reverse engineering. <span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><p class="line874">There are stubs/shells for many different languages, but the following are mature enough to be distributed with ArgoUML: C++ (Cpp), C# (Csharp), classfile, IDL, and PHP. Others at various stages of development include: Python, Ruby, and SQL. <span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><p class="line867"><img src="Languages.gif" title="Languages.gif" /> <span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><a href="CategoryFromCookbook.html">CategoryFromCookbook</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div><p id="pageinfo" class="info" lang="en" dir="ltr">&lt;&lt;Subsystem&gt;&gt; Other source languages (C++, Python, etc)  (last edited 2009-03-06 14:57:49 -0700 by <span title="Linus Tolke @ localhost[127.0.0.1]"><a href="linus.html" title="Linus Tolke @ localhost[127.0.0.1]">linus</a></span>)</p>
