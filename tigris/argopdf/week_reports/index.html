    <h3>Week Report #9</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Almost completed the class diagrams part of the report (almost, because during class diagram part implementation i decided 
          to add some more options of the the class diagram to the report)</li>	   
    </ul>

    <p>

            After discussion with Linus Tolke, some things, which need to be improved, was defined.</li>
	  <li>Started to implement the class diagram part of the report</li>
    </ul>

<div class="h3">
    <h3>Week Report #7</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Modified the report contents tree in the ArgoPDF dialog: moved all use cases in one folder.</li>
        <li>Implemented <i>UseCasesDiagramHelper</i> class. This class contains utility methods, which help during report generation and
            working with Use Case diagrams.</li>
	  <li>Implemented <i>ReportUtils</i> class. This class contains general methods, which help during report generation.</li>
        <li>Implemented the use case diagrams part of the report. Now, for each use case diagram, it includes an image of this diagram and a summary table. 
            Summary table can include actors and use cases with its names and documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <h4>The problems which i had had during these week:</h4>
        <ul>
		<li>I had a problem of inserting images in the report. But it was solved.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h4>My objectives on the next week:</h4>
        <ul>
	    <li>Add detailed info in the use case diagrams part of the report for every element of the use case diagram.</li>
          <li>Start to implement the class diagrams part of the report.</li>	   
        </ul>
    </p>

</div>

<div class="h3">
    <h3>Week Report #6</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Designed the basic interface for the report and partly implemented it.</li>
	<li>Explored Model subsystem API. Right now, i understand how to get access to ArgoUML data.</li>
	<li>Designed and developed title page of the report. So, now, you can choose options for title page in
	    ArgoPDF dialog and it will be generated.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <h4>The problems which i had had during these week:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The main problem was with the Model subsystem API. I have spent a lot of time exploring it for finding what i need.</li>
            <li>Next small problem was with iText library. I have spent more time than i expected for implementing the generation
                of title page. My knowledge of using iText was not enought, so it was necessary to read "iText in Action" book. But
                now i am sure that the process of implementation the diagrams will be in a better way.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <h4>My objectives on the next week:</h4>
        <ul>
	    <li>Continue to work on the reports. First of all, i want to make a possibility to generate Use Case diagrams (which i didn't do this week because of my problems with Model subsystem API and iText library).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
    <h3>Week Report #5</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Designed and developed the ArgoPDF dialog.</li>
        <li>Described in the documentation ArgoPDF dialog. You can find it <a href="../nonav/docs/user_interface.html">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        <h4>My objectives on the next week:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Continue to write ArgoPDF documentation.</li>
            <li>Start to work on the report: design and develop title page and some other parts of the report. 
            Write the basic prototype to understand how to extract information from the ArgoUML and to use it in the report.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
    <h3>Week Report #3, #4</h3>

        <li>Ended to read ArgoUML cookbook.</li>
        <li>Reviewed code of ArgoUML and understood the main concepts of creating modules for ArgoUML.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        <h4>The problems which i had had during these two weeks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The main problem is that i did't have enough time because of my university examinations.</li>
            <li>Next problem is that i can't exactly define the structure of the report. I am sure this problem 
                will be solved during discussion with developers of ArgoUML.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <h4>My objectives on the next week:</h4>

            <li>Design, develop and describe in the documentation ArgoPDF dialog, which will be displayed when ArgoPDF
                starts from the ArgoUML.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<div class="h3">
	<h3>Week Report #1</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Applied for an Observer role in the argouml project</li>
		<li><div>Linus and Ion created a separate project for ArgoPDF: argopdf.tigris.com
	        <br>Applied for Observer and Developer roles in this project
      	    <br>Subscribed to the dev, commits, issues and users lists of argoPDF</div></li>
		<li>I have read Manual of Subversion</li>
		<li>I made work copy of ArgoUML and ArgoPrint</li>
		<li>Start to read ArgoUML cookbook and review code.</li>
		<li>I have read docs of ArgoPrint</li>
		<li><div>My first problem was, when i tried to compile the source code of ArgoUML, i had errors in 4 files.
      	         <br>I tried to find the problem, and found <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=commits&msgNo=1447">this</a>.
            	 <br>All what mvw did, was not working, because ToolBarFactory do not have public constructor. I was watching toolbar v1.3 
	                 and toolbar v1.4beta.</div></li>
		<li><div>Next problem, When i returned the changes of mvw of this 4 files to compile ArgoUML, i tried to run it. 
			     And I had an exception: java.lang.AbstractMethodError. This is my <a href="logs/AbstractMethodError_w1.txt">logs</a>.
			</div></li>
		<li><div>Next point of what i almost did, is the first view of the architecture of ArgoPDF.
			     I want to describe the main conceptions and how ArgoPDF will work.
            	 I planed to end it today, but by the reason of my troubles with compiling and running ArgoUML i didn't do it.
            </div></li>
	</ul>

      <p>
		<h4>My objectives on the next week:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>To find out, why changes, made by mvw, is not working (what solution is correct)</li>
			<li>What is the reason of my failure in compiling and running ArgoUML</li>
			<li>Finish to describe my first view of the architecture of ArgoPDF</li>
			<li>Continue reading ArgoUML cookbook and review code to find out what will be useful for ArgoPDF</li>
